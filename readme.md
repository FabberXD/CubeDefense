# CubeDefense
CubeDefense is Tower defense game inspired by TDS (Roblox game)  
Developers: SysFAB & Nanskip  

* Genre: Tower defense  
* Max players: 4  

## Main idea
In CubeDefense you will have to create lobby to play the game (multiplayer compatible)  
After games you can spend money on towers (unlock new ones to play with)  
And upgrade your towers to be more powerful (in-game and after game permanent upgrades)  

## Current stage
Currently, CubeDefense is only on planning stage, so stay tuned!
